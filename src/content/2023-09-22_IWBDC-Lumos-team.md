## Legion of Legends (LoL)

Hey! We're a small team of passionate people with a common goal to build India's best browser ever! All of us are IIT BHU graduates and are currently working in different fields of software development. What unites us, you ask? It's our passion to survive on coffee and code for tens of sleepless nights! :P

### Shivansh Saini

My journey in the tech industry began with the founding of my own startup, a food tech venture, where I played a pivotal role in building end-to-end solutions. From developing the Android app to crafting the RESTful backend and implementing robust CI/CD pipelines on the Google Cloud Platform, I gained invaluable experience across the entire software development lifecycle.

Drawing inspiration from industry pioneers such as Kent Beck and Martin Fowler, I am committed to adhering to best practices and embracing a holistic approach to development. My versatile nature allows me to immerse myself in various languages, frameworks, and libraries, and I actively engage with others' code to enhance my expertise. My dedication to writing well-documented code reflects my belief in fostering maintainable and collaborative projects.

What sets me apart is my insatiable appetite for learning. I have embraced technologies like GraphQL, Solidity, and Rust to expand my skillset. My background in managing large-scale, production-ready cloud-native infrastructure has ingrained in me a passion for crafting reliable, fault-tolerant services complemented by an observability layer that empowers efficient debugging. Even within my personal k3s cluster, security hardening and robust observability remain paramount.

My involvement in the open-source community has equipped me with remote work skills and asynchronous communication practices. From my participation in Google Summer of Code with Videolan and CERN-HSF to my engagement with Chaos Mesh through LFX, I have seamlessly adapted to new challenges. An exemplary instance of this adaptability was my initiative to build a Kubernetes operator when the SDK was in its alpha release, underscoring my ability to innovate and lead in uncharted territory.

I have completed my B.Tech in CSE from IIT BHU in the year 2021.  In the past, I have worked on various projects including web/app development projects, NLP projects during my college coursework. I interned at Microsoft and am currently working at Microsoft for the last 2 years.

During my internships, I have worked on developing a Windows application for debugging surface devices. We used the WPF framework for making the application. 

Currently, I am working in the team that develops and maintains WPF ( Windows Presentation Framework ) - a UI framework for developing Windows applications. 

Apart from this, I have worked on several NLP projects and have a research paper on the same. Here's some of my past projects:

#### Contour Rendering
This project allowed me to dive into the world of computer graphics, where we used C++ and OpenGL graphics API library to develop an application that allows you to convert contour maps into 3D models. 
This allowed me to understand the internals of computer graphics and how rendering engine works. 
This project also allowed me to work with low-level performant languages like C++ and helped me understand the complexity involved in considering performance when working with the graphics engine

#### WPF 
WPF is a well-established UI framework developed by Microsoft and was launched around 2006. 
This project allowed me to work on a very complex software project with multiple components interacting with different OS components like - imaging, speech components, other UI frameworks for interoperability, Accessibility and automation stack on Windows, printing and other hardware drivers, XPS ( a format similar to PDF ) document parsing and printing stack. 
WPF has tight integration with the DirectX rendering engine and is written with performance in mind. This allowed me to take a deep dive into how low-level graphic APIs work. 
WPF being part of .NET, puts attention to localization and accessibility, which helped me understand the complexity of localization ( that's required with multilingual support ) 
WPF is shipped with Windows update and these updates are in place updates, similar to what we will be achieving with automatic upgrade of our browser.
