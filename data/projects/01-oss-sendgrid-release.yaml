subtitle: Automating release notes and updating the remote
description: >-
  The bash script would automatically judge the correct release notes to use, by reading through the CHANGELOG file and considering the
  current tagged version in git. It'll then push an update to the GitHub repo, by posting a new release with this note.
work:
  - Wrote a bash utility script to auto-generate release notes for a git repo, based on the latest commit tags and CHANGELOG text.
  - Uses releases endpoint of Github API to push the obtained notes to the configured repository.
