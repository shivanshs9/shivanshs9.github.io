title: VLC for Android (GSoC'19)
subtitle: “Tests are stories we tell the next generation of programmers on a project.”
description: >-
  The project aims to contribute to the stability of Android port of VLC, by writing test suites for the VLC android codebase.
  This will ensure that the regressions are caught by developers at an early stage and the released application stays stable.
work:
  - Wrote test suites in Kotlin for the VLC Android codebase.
  - Decoupled the existing codebase, using Abstract Factory Manager design pattern, to run unit tests without the native android SDK or native VLC libraries.
  - Wrote instrumentation tests for the application’s interface to ensure the correct behaviours of UI views.
  - Stubbed the integral components of codebase and wrote mocks for external dependencies to various System under Test.
  - Integrated my unit tests with the Gitlab CI/CD pipeline.
