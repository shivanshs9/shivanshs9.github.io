title: VM Migration for Green Cloud Computing
subtitle: ''
description: >-
  To accomodate the high energy consumption of cloud data centres, a meta-heuristic algorithmic approach is implemented for dynamic Virtual Machines consolidations
  in live environment. Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is used for this purpose.
work:
  - Implemented Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for optimal VM migrations and wrote simulation in Cloudsim Plus.
  - Benchmarked the algorithm on the open data, provided by NAS Systems division at NASA Ames Research Center in 1993, and compared it with 4 other heuristic approaches.
