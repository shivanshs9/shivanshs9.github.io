  A personal blogging webapp, where I can jot down my technical ideas and thoughts. It also happens to showcase many of my past projects,
  so I never lose track of what I haven't done yet. :D
work:
  - Used gatsby's starter project by Calpa Liu.
  - Wrote GraphQL queries to fetch YAML data for this projects page.
  - Implemented various React components, like skill-o-meter.
