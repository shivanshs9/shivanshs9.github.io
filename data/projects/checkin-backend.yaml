title: Checkin API
subtitle: 'Django-powered REST API for Checkin app'
description: >-
  It's a client-independent API to power the functionality of android app. The schema is defined with OpenAPI specifications.
work:
  - Worked primarily on developing a RESTful API on the Django backend.
  - Deployed the backend on Kubernetes cluster and used Ingress as a reverse proxy. I centralized both the production and staging web services into a single entrypoint, using the Ingress.
  - Incorporated semantic versioning to the API by the creative use of Makefile and git commands.
