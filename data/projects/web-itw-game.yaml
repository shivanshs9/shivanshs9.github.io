  This project aims to develop a MMORPG web game using RPG Maker MV engine and Django ASGI for the backend server.
  It supports real-time player interactions, group chat and cloud save. It was part of my Information Technology Workshop - II project.
work:
  - Implemented real-time bidirectional communication between the game client and the web server with the help of websockets technology.
  - Developed RPG Maker MV plugins in Javascript to support online payloads for the existing single-player setup.
  - Used Redis-backend Django Channels on top of ASGI interface to support fast, asynchronous data-exchange on long-living websocket connections.
